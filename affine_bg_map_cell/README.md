# affine_bg_map_cell demo

A short demo to show how to use `bn::affine_bg_map_cell` as a unique tile id.

This uses the method I described in [my itch.io article](https://copyrat90.itch.io/sym-merged/devlog/263735/platforming-physics), which is now **OBSOLETE** because Butano provides `bn::affine_bg_map_cell_info` now.\
See [regular_bg_map_cell](../regular_bg_map_cell) demo instead.

## Dependencies

This program uses [Butano](https://github.com/GValiente/butano), which is licensed under the zlib license.
