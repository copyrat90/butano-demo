# affine_bg_map_cell demo

A short demo to show how to use `bn::affine_bg_map_cell` as a unique tile id.

There's a [demo for `bn::regular_bg_map_cell`](https://github.com/copyrat90/butano_affine_bg_map_cell_demo/tree/regular_bg_map_cell), too.\
But it's slightly different, so you can't just use the same method I described in [my itch.io article](https://copyrat90.itch.io/sym-merged/devlog/263735/platforming-physics).

## Dependencies

This program uses [Butano](https://github.com/GValiente/butano), which is licensed under zlib license.
